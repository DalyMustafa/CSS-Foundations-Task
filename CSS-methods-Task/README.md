# Methods for Adding CSS

In this exercise, you're going to practice adding CSS to an HTML file using all three methods: external CSS, internal CSS, and inline CSS. You should only be using type selectors for this exercise when adding styles via the external and internal methods. You should also use keywords for colors (e.g. "blue") instead of using RGB or HEX values.

There are some elements for you to add styles to, each of which uses a different method of adding CSS to it. This task is all about practicing using these different methods and getting the syntax right.

### Instructions
- Fork and clone this repository.
- Create a CSS file and link it with the HTML file.
- The properties you need to add to each element are:
   - `h1`: a green text, a font size of 45px, center aligned, and font family of your choice.
   - `p`:  a font size of 45px.
   - `img`: a border radius of 10px, width of 400px;
   - `li`: font size of 20px, font family of your choice.
   - `button`: a green background, beige text, font size of 20px, width of 150px, border radius of 10px.
   - `body`: a wheat background color.

### Self Check
- Did you use all three methods of adding CSS to an HTML file?
- Did you properly link the external CSS file in the HTML file?
- Do the `h1` and `p` elements have CSS added via the external method?
- Do the `img` and `li` elements have CSS added via the inline method?
- Does the `button` element have CSS added via the inline method?
